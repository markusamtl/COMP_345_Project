/**
 * @brief Driver function to test the CommandProcessor class, by command line.
 * 
 * This version uses ONLY console input for commands, and interacts directly
 * with the GameEngine instance. All game events and outputs are logged to
 * ../CommandProcessing/Games/ with timestamped filenames.
 * 
 * Each phase dynamically shows the user which commands are valid to enter.
 * It also includes recovery logic â€” if map loading or validation fails, the
 * engine resets to Start.
