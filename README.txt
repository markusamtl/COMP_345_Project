- **valgrind**

Install them (if needed) with:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++ cmake make valgrind

**BUILD INTRUCTIONS FOR CMKAE**

1) Navigate to root directory: cd COMP_345_PROJECT
2) Create and enter build directory: mkdir build && cd build
3) Run cmake, and build the drivers: cmake .. && make

This **SHOULD** be successful.

To run the driver, run the following commands:

MAIN DRIVER:

Without Valgrind: ./main_driver
With Valgrind: make run_main_valgrind
