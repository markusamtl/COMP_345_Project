GALAXY MAP

This is not your average, run-of-the-mill PocketConquest (or PC Conquest) map!!
It has a special feature which makes for a very unique game!

This map consists of 49 territories divided into 5 "continents".

Four of the "continents" are the 4 quadrants of the galaxy: Alpha, Beta, Gamma and 
Delta.  The fifth is called the "Galactic Wormhole" and consists of the single territory at the center of the field.

The unique aspect of this game is as follows:  every territory on the map can attack the Galactic Wormhole, but the Galactic Wormhole cannot attack ANY territory!  

In addition, the Galactic Wormhole alone is worth 10 armies per turn!

During the game, you have to make a choice, will you go for the Galactic Wormhole and try to defend it so you can get the armies?  Every player (including the computer players, who are crazy about this territory!) will want to take it from you!  

Alternatively, you could go for the quadrants, which are worth 5 armies per turn. 

When loading the game, you will get an "Errors in map" screen, due to the wormhole not being able to attack anything.  Just press OK to bypass this message, and the game will work perfectly.

A few things to remember:

1. Remember that during your strategic move, you can move armies from ANY territory into the Galactic Wormhole, but those armies can never come out!

2. Don't forget that you can attack the wormhole from anywhere!

3. The different card settings have a big effect on what strategy will work best in this game!  If you choose "Depends" or "Limit", you'd better not let another player build up a large army on the wormhole, or he'll be impossible to beat!  In the "Increases" mode, the Wormhole will be the scene of some HUGE battles!

Have fun!
