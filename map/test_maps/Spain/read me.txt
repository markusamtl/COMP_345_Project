Hi, my name is Dani, I am a Spanish fun of this game. I have done the
"diplomacybetter" map encouraging a Sean's map. But now this map is only mine.
This is a Spain map of our days. The continents are the "Comunidades Autónomas"
and the countries are the "Provincias". Each continent earns 1 cohort for
every country whith an external frontier.

I hope you'll enjoy this map.
